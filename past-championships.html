          <h3>7/1/21</h3>
          <p>This was the very first Canyon Creek Championship, with three full 18-hole rounds played in just one day.
          The rounds were played at <a href="https://udisc.com/courses/wells-branch-dgc-SFG9" target="_blank">Wells Branch Disc Golf Course</a> in Austin, <a href="https://udisc.com/courses/rivery-park-wFkY" target="_blank">Rivery Park</a> in Georgetown, and finally 
          <a href="https://udisc.com/courses/old-settlers-park-dgc-GDmw" target="_blank">Old Settler's Park</a>. We had four competitors at this first CCC where, at the end of it, the first CCC Champion 
          was crowned, Brandon Becker.</p>

          <h3>12/20/21</h3>
          <p>The second instance of the Canyon Creek Championship was held in the winter of 2021. This time around we 
            were able to include an additional competitor, bumping our total to 5 players. Again this tournament was played
            over one day and included three full-length 18-hole courses in the Austin area. This time we played first at <a href="https://udisc.com/courses/zilker-park-dgc-RxQm" target="_blank">Zilker
            Park</a>, then at <a href="https://udisc.com/courses/met-center-95HO" target="_blank">Met Center</a>, and finally concluded our second-ever CCC at <a href="https://udisc.com/courses/roy-g-guerrero-dgc-aKOV" target="_blank">Roy G Guerrero Park</a> where Brandon Becker 
            once again took down the tournament and became back-to-back Canyon Creek Champion. The scores at the top were definitely
            close, with Brandon winning with a 1-shot lead over Perry Jamail and a 5-shot lead over Brayden Sherrod.</p>

          <h3>6/2/22</h3>
          <p>The third Canyon Creek Championship was the least-attended tournamnet to date due to availability conflicts.
            However, that didn't mean it was any less exciting or fun to play. The tournament was once again played over
            one day and included three full-length rounds. The first and second rounds were played at <a href="https://udisc.com/courses/zilker-park-dgc-RxQm" target="_blank">Zilker Park</a> - the first
            and only instance of this happening in CCC history so far. The third and final round was played at <a href="https://udisc.com/courses/met-center-95HO" target="_blank">Met Center</a>, where
            Brandon Becker was named the three-time Canyon Creek Champion with his biggest blowout win yet, leading the rest of the 
            group with a 6-shot lead.</p>

          <h3>12/20/22</h3>
          <p>The fourth and most recent Canyon Creek Championship was also the shortest in length but largest in attendance.
            For this tournament we were able to have 6 competitors and also changed the format to be two full-length rounds 
            over two days. We started things off with a round at <a href="https://udisc.com/courses/cat-hollow-5qPH" target="_blank">Cat Hollow</a> and completed the tournamnet the following day 
            with a final round at <a href="https://udisc.com/courses/old-settlers-park-dgc-GDmw" target="_blank">Old Settler's Park</a> where Perry Jamail was crowned first-time Canyon Creek Champion, ending 
            Brandon's streak of dominance thusfar.</p>
