        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The Canyon Creek Championship is an exclusive semi-annual 
          Disc Golf tournament hosted and run for a group of friends out of Austin, Texas 
          every winter and summer. The first Canyon Creek Championship (CCC) was held on July 1st, 
          2021 and consisted of three 18-hole Disc Golf courses in one day: Wells Branch DGC, Rivery
          Park, and Old Settlers Park. More recent Championships have split the rounds over different days
          and/or shortened the number of rounds played. If you would like to learn more about the past Championships
          and their winners please navigate to the "Past Championships" section for details.</p>
