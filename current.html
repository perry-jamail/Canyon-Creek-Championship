            <p>The current upcoming Canyon Creek Championship is scheduled for the weekend of July 22nd through July 23rd. The 
                plan is to play three 18-hole courses over two days out near Tyler, Texas. The first two rounds will be played at 
                <a href="https://udisc.com/courses/black-berry-pines-disc-and-camp-KGPJ" target="_blank">Blackberry Pines Disc Golf Course</a> in Pittsburg, Texas on the 22nd while the third and final round will be played 
                at the difficult <a href="https://udisc.com/courses/lindsey-park-dgc-dogwood-yellow-Xv7q" target="_blank">Lindsey Park Disc Golf Course</a> (otherwise known as Dogwood) in Tyler on the 23rd. Currently we have 
                six planned competitors for this CCC - tied for the most we have had at any of our previous championships! We are very excited to try out these new-to-the-tournament courses and see who will be 
                crowned Canyon Creek Champion next!
